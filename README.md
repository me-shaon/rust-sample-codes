# rust-sample-codes
This repository consists of some sample codes written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) (mostly for practice pupose). 

### How to use 
Install Rust from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), if you don't have rust installed already.

Building and running a rust program is easy. Just type `rustc file_name.rs`. It will create the binary executable. And then run it like any other executables (based on your OS). You can learn more about it from [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/getting-started.html#writing-and-running-a-rust-program)
